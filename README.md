# Mousemacs

Mousemacs is an Emacs setup for those who want the power of Emacs but also want to use a mouse.

Mousemacs comes with the following:
- Standard keyboard shortcuts for cut/copy/paste.
- Similar keyboard shortcuts to Visual Studo Code or Sublime Text.
- File open in tabs and can be closed with a menu.
- A useful context menu with useful shortcuts.
- A built in file explorer (NeoTree).

Underneath Mousemacs is still Emacs.
